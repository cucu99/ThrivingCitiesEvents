      "Bringing the World to Memphis....and Memphis to the World! This month-long event brings education, fun, music and BBQ to the Bluff City. Enjoy tunes from classic artists as well as today's radio stars at the Beale Street Music Festival May 4-6. This festival showcases musicians from every music style imaginable. Artist this year include: Post Malone, Jack White, Queens of the Stone Age, Margo Price, Love Light Orchestra, Robert Randolf and the Family Band and more. The top BBQ teams converge on the bank of the Mississippi River during the World Championship Barbecue Cooking Contest on May 17-19. Being the best in show at this competition offers a big prize check and some serious, saucy street cred. The celebration closes with the 901Fest featuring local musicians on May 26 followed by the Great American River Run (half marathon and 5k) on May 26. Memphis in May honors a different country each year. This year, the honored country is Czech Republic.
